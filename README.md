# AntsvsSomeBees

This is one of my school projects Ants vs SomeBees.

Based off of the game Plants vs Zombies, the goal of this game is to eliminate all of the bees using different kinds of ants. I implemented most of ants.py, where the game play is mostly defined.  Here, you can find several types of ants and bees with different powers and functionality.  

In order to run the game, download the code and run from the command line in the appropriate directory:

python3 ants_gui.py --food 10

You can adjust how much food you start out with in order to change the difficulty of the game.
